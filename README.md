# Generating Installers

These mix tasks generate binary installers for your Elixir-Desktop project in corresponding native formats. Currently supported output formats are:

* Windows: `.exe` installer (NSIS based)
* MacOS: `.dmg` download package
* Linux: `.run` makeself installer.

## Usage

1. Add a new release to your project configuration that includes the `&Desktop.Deployment.generate_installer/1` steps
2. Add the `package: package()` configuration with your app packaging information. If you don't provide these, default values will be used.
3. Run `mix desktop.installer` to generate the installer for your current OS

```elixir
  def project do
    [
      package: package(),
      releases: [
        default: [
          applications: [runtime_tools: :permanent, ssl: :permanent],
          steps: [:assemble, &Desktop.Deployment.generate_installer/1]
        ],
      ],
    ]
  end

  def package() do
    [
      name: "MyApp",
      name_long: "The most wonderfull App Ever",
      description: "MyApp is an Elixir App for Desktop",
      description_long: "MyApp for Desktop is powered by Phoenix LiveView",
      icon: "priv/icon.png",
      # https://developer.gnome.org/menu-spec/#additional-category-registry
      category_gnome: "GNOME;GTK;Office;",
      category_macos: "public.app-category.productivity",
      identifier: "io.myapp.app",
    ]
  end  
```

## Installation

The the package can be installed
by adding `desktop_deployment` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:desktop_deployment, "~> 0.1", runtimes: false}
  ]
end
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Windows -> NSIS

All builds (specifically NIFs) are built using msys2, because it's mostly linux compatible but runs natively on windows without any helper libraries. 

0) Installing prerequsites
  - msys2.org
  - `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-imagemagick mingw-w64-x86_64-nsis mingw-w64-x86_64-nsis mingw-w64-x86_64-osslsigncode mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl`

1) `mix deployment` will generate the release binaries

To support windows code signing the user has to create two certificate files `app_key.pem` and `app_key.pem` (e.g. get from sectigo) and put them into the `rel/win32/` subdirectory. 

#### Known Issues / Comments

* The `.vbs` file is used as indirection for the `.bat` file as it avoid creating a black terminal screen that otherwise flashes shortly when launchin a `.bat` file directly

* The `.nsis` file currently registers a `app://` protocol handler, this is example use and can be removed for other apps.

* After having done static builds for iOS now we're thinking a pure `.exe` build for Windows might actually be a much cleaner solution. But TBD

### MacOS -> DMG

MacOS has two variants ARM (M1,2,3...) and legacy x86 if you want to enable your builds on both platforms the easiest way is to have the CI (e.g. GitHub) have the build done on a x86_64 machine. Then the rosetta compatibility layer will make it runnable on ARM too. For this rosetta is enabled explicitly in the `.plist` file for ARM machines.

Code signing is done as part of the `desktop.installer` task if and only if a developer_id is provided. This can be provided through one of these environment variables:

- `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID` - String of the user uid
- `MACOS_PEM` - PEM file with both user uid and user certificate for signing

In addition the keychain to be used can be specified using:
- `MACOS_KEYCHAIN` - Name/path of the keychain defaults to the result of `security login-keychain`


1) `mix desktop.installer`
2) `mix desktop.notarize <username@apple_account.com> <app_specific_password> <team_id> _build/prod/*.dmg`

#### Known Issues / Comments

* Background images for the deployment window of the `.dmg` (when clicking that on macos) are hardcoded in the rel/macosx/ subdirectory. I've not yet discovered how to properly (dynamically) create them. Also haven't found out how to set the DMGs icon to be non-standard as some apps do.

* Best to use the most recent wxWidgets on macos, as e.g. taskbar icon size bug fixes are only present there.

### Linux -> makeself

#### Known Issues / Comments

* wxWidgets notifications+taskbar support is really varying accross distributions. Currently we have a pure Elixir dbus implementation.

* Getting distribution independent linux binaries is really though. Main issues have been library dependencies of different versions. Future thoughts for this:
    * Switch to AppImage
    * Switch to deb packages
    * other?
